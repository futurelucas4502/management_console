In the future this guide may change as I will get codesigning but right now I don't own an apple device and need to ring apple before they will let me enable it.

## How to use the program:

See [here](./how-to-use)

## Not using macOS:

If your OS is not macOS see the links below:

* [Windows](./windows "Windows Docs") 32/64 bit
* [Linux](./linux "Linux Docs") that supports AppImage files (most do)

If your OS or architecture isn't in the above list e.g. windows ARM don't worry you can learn how to build it for your OS [here](./unsupported "Unsupported OS").
